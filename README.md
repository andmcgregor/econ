#Econ

A side project to visualize international trade statistics for goods, as categorized by the [Harmonized System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonized_System), using data from the [UN COMTRADE database](http://comtrade.un.org/). I was interested in experimenting with 3d web technology and to learn/build something using React.
